# Complex Number

This is a C++ implementation of complex numbers using templates. The `Complex` class supports the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as the conjugate and magnitude operations.

## Requirements

The Matrix class requires a C++ compiler that supports C++20 or later.

## Usage

To use the `Complex` class, simply include the `Complex.hpp` header file in your C++ code:

```cpp
#include "Complex.hpp"

Complex<double> c2(1.0, 2.0); // (1 + 2i)
```

## Functionality

The `Complex` class supports the following functionality:

- Creation of complex numbers with a given real and imaginary part
- Retrieval of the real and imaginary parts of a complex number
- Setting the real and imaginary parts of a complex number
- Calculation of the conjugate and magnitude of a complex number
- Arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
